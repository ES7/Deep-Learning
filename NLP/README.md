# NLP (Natural Language Processing)
**NLP from Scratch :-** https://medium.com/@ageitgey/natural-language-processing-is-fun-9a0bff37854e </br>
NLP is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way 
that is both meaningful and useful. NLP involves the interaction between computers and human language, encompassing tasks such as text analysis,
language generation, language translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and more. </br>
Some of the key components and tasks within NLP include :- 
* **Tokenization :** Breaking text into individual words, phrases, or symbols (tokens) for further analysis.
* **Part-of-Speech Tagging :** Assigning grammatical parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) to each word in a sentence.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER) :** Identifying and categorizing named entities (such as names of people, organizations, locations) within text.
* **Sentiment Analysis :** Determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
* **Language Modeling :** Developing statistical models that predict the likelihood of a sequence of words occurring in a sentence.
* **Machine Translation :** Automatically translating text from one language to another.
* **Text Generation :** Creating coherent and contextually relevant text, which can range from simple sentences to complex paragraphs.
* **Question Answering :** Designing systems that can answer questions posed in natural language.
* **Speech Recognition :** Converting spoken language into text.
* **Text Summarization :** Automatically generating concise and coherent summaries of longer texts.
* **Dialog Systems :** Creating chatbots or virtual assistants that can engage in natural language conversations.
* **Topic Modeling :** Identifying the main topics or themes present in a collection of documents.
* **Word Embeddings :** Representing words as dense vectors in a continuous space to capture semantic relationships.
