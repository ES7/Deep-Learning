Using NLP I have performed sentiment analysis on the comments collected from Google Play Store and Apple App Store, for the data scrapping I have used `google play scrapper`
for play store and `app store scrapper` for app store. I have used the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library to perform this task. </br>
Here first I have scrape the data (reviews) from the play store and app store of respective app. And then using the NLTK library I have performed the basic NLP operations 
to find the sentiments of the reviews and classify them as **POSITIVE** sentences or **NEGATIVE** sentences.
