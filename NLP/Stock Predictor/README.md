# 1/10 Predictor
In the `Data Scraping` folder I have wrote code for scraping Twitter comments using `TwitterAPI` and `snscrape` library. Inside the `Models` folder, in the `LLM.ipynb` I have used `BERT` model for sentiment analysis and applied it to all the scraped comments of a particular stock. And using the sentiment score the code predicts whether the stocks goes UP or DOWN.
