# Deep-Learning
In this repository I have uploaded all my codes that I have wrote when I was a beginner in Deep Learning. This repository contains the basic application of the  following concepts :- NLP(Natural Language Processing), GAN(Generative Adversarial Network), LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory), CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).
