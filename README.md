# Deep-Learning
In this repository I have uploaded all my codes that I have learned when I was a beginner in Deep Learning. This repository contains the basic application of the  following concepts :-
* **CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network)
* **NLP** (Natural Language Processing)
* **GAN** (Generative Adversarial Network)
* **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory)
