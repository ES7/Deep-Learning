# Sign Language
I have created a CNN model and trained it on sign language dataset from kaggle. After the model was trained I used the model with OpenCV for detection. 
The data is present in the *"data"* folder and the model is saved in *"saved"* folder. `CNN.ipynb` is the code of model and `signlanguage.py` is the application of model with OpenCV.
